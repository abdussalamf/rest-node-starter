# REST API using Node.js
This starter project is meant to be a showcase. Most of the features in this project are implementations of some online courses I learned from Udemy.

## Overview
This project is mainly focused on CRUD requests by authorized users. Some interesting features in this project are :

- Clusterizations. This is a feature provided by Node to enable single-threaded Node.js ability to handle multiple processes and enhance its performance. Although the usage in this project is simple and straightforward, hopefully it still gives insight and overview about the feature. More about this can be found on https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/clustering-in-nodejs-utilizing-multiple-processor-cores-75d78aeb0f4f

- Centralized error handling. By utilizing express middleware ability to catch error, errors in services are thrown beforehand rather than directly returned to client.
